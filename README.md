# Privacy-Preserving-Audience-Generator
Generate statistically identical synthetic data while preserving user privacy. MirrorData is a Generative AI tool built with PyTorch and Streamlit. It uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn the underlying distribution of sensitive tabular data (such as user metrics or sensor logs) and generates high-quality synthetic "mirror" data.
